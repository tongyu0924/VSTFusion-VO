# SwinFusion-VO: A Monocular Visual Odometry via Swin-based Multimodal Fusion

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/aofrancani/TSformer-VO/blob/main/LICENSE)
 

This project is based on **[aofrancani/TSformer-VO](https://github.com/aofrancani/TSformer-VO)**, with architectural modifications inspired by SWFormer-VO.
We replace TimeSformer with a Video Swin Transformer (stages 1–3) and introduce early fusion of RGB and pseudo-depth inputs.

## Overview

This project integrates ideas from TSformer-VO and SWFormer-VO,  
introducing a Swin-based multimodal VO framework with the following modifications:

- Replacing the original Timesformer backbone with **Video Swin Transformer** (stages 1–3).
- Introducing **early fusion of RGB and Depth embeddings** before feature encoding.
- Retaining the temporal structure of the original architecture while improving its adaptability to multimodal inputs.
- Evaluating on **KITTI Odometry**, showing improvements over the original model in three key metrics:  
  - **↓8.76%** Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE)  
  - **↓2.54%** Relative Pose Error (RPE)

### KITTI Odometry Evaluation

| Sequence | Trans. Error (%) | Rot. Error (°/100m) | ATE (m) | RPE (m) | RPE (°) |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| 01       | 25.11            | 5.77                | 76.28   | 0.703   | 0.260   |

| 05       | 9.39             | 4.09                | 42.31   | 0.104   | 0.201   |

| 07       | 8.20             | 6.44                | 19.53   | 0.102   | 0.214   |
| 10       | 8.65             | 3.45                | 14.33   | 0.117   | 0.241   |

Evaluation was performed using [kitti-odom-eval](https://github.com/Huangying-Zhan/kitti-odom-eval) with 7-DoF alignment.

## Abstract

*This work builds upon TSformer-VO by incorporating early-stage fusion of RGB and depth inputs via the Video Swin Transformer. We explore the impact of a hierarchical attention-based backbone in visual odometry tasks, treating the problem as a spatiotemporal sequence understanding challenge. Our model demonstrates improved accuracy on the KITTI dataset, highlighting the benefits of Swin-based feature extraction in multimodal settings.*

## 1. Dataset
Download the [KITTI Odometry dataset (grayscale)](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) for training and evaluation.

RGB images are stored in `.jpg` format.  
Use [png_to_jpg.py](https://github.com/aofrancani/DPT-VO/blob/main/util/png_to_jpg.py) to convert the original `.png` files.

The **depth maps** are pseudo-depths generated by [Monodepth2](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2),  
predicted from grayscale KITTI frames and saved as `.jpeg` images.

The data structure should be as follows:
```
TSformer-VO/
└── data/
    ├── sequences_jpg/
    │   ├── 00/
    │   │   └── image_0/
    │   │       ├── 000000.jpg           # RGB image
    │   │       ├── 000000_disp.jpeg     # Depth map (Monodepth2)
    │   │       ├── 000001.jpg
    │   │       ├── 000001_disp.jpeg
    │   │       └── ...
    │   ├── 01/
    │   └── ...
    └── poses/
        ├── 00.txt
        ├── 01.txt
        └── ...
```

## 2. Pre-trained models

Here you find the checkpoints of our trained-models.

**Google Drive folder**: [link to checkpoints in GDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdUS6J6jkKsSrhkCWJV7k3cJTQIqnUCi/view?usp=sharing)


## 3. Setup
- Create a virtual environment using Anaconda and activate it:
```
conda create -n tsformer-vo python==3.8.0
conda activate tsformer-vo
```
- Install dependencies (with environment activated):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Usage

**PS**: So far we are changing the settings and hyperparameters directly in the variables and dictionaries. As further work, we will use pre-set configurations with the `argparse` module to make a user-friendly interface.

### 4.1. Training

In `train.py`:
- Manually set configuration in `args` (python dict);
- Manually set the model hyperparameters in `model_params` (python dict);
- Save and run the code `train.py`.

### 4.2. Inference

In `predict_poses.py`:
- Manually set the variables to read the checkpoint and sequences.

| **Variables**   | **Info**                                                                                                             |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| checkpoint_path | String with the path to the trained model you want to use for inference.  Ex: checkpoint_path = "checkpoints/Model1" |
| checkpoint_name | String with the name of the desired checkpoint (name of the .pth file).  Ex: checkpoint_name = "checkpoint_model2_exp19" |
| sequences       | List with strings representing the KITTI sequences.  Ex: sequences = ["03", "04", "10"]                              |

### 4.3. Visualize Trajectories
In `plot_results.py`:
- Manually set the variables to the checkpoint and desired sequences, similarly to [Inference](#42-inference)


## 5. Evaluation
The evaluation is done with the [KITTI odometry evaluation toolbox](https://github.com/Huangying-Zhan/kitti-odom-eval). Please go to the [evaluation repository](https://github.com/Huangying-Zhan/kitti-odom-eval) to see more details about the evaluation metrics and how to run the toolbox.
